# Scorekeeper XXL

A big-screen score keeper built with React. Functionality and design heavily borrowed from Matt Rix's mobile app, [Scorekeeper XL](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/scorekeeper-xl/id463243024?mt=8).

I used this app as a learning experience for React. I haven't implemented all functionality. The code might suck!
